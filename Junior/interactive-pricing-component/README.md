## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.
